# CI security gates bootstrap

> Use with `/security-pass bootstrap` after `01_tech_stack.md` exists.  
> Works with `security-bootstrap.md` (app security in `02`) and `ci-gates-catalog.md` (pipeline gates in `08`).

## Read first

1. `python3 .agent/scripts/meridian_delivery.py quality-profile` — cap audit/CodeQL to declared tier
2. `docs/01_tech_stack.md` — languages, package managers, hosting  
3. `docs/08_environments.md` — existing CI section  
4. `.agent/skills/test-strategy/references/ci-gates-catalog.md`

## Procedure

```txt
1. Run quality-profile — document supply-chain gates only when tier is full (unless human opted in)
2. List languages and lockfiles present in this product repo
3. Map languages → CodeQL matrix rows (include only languages in use)
4. Map lockfiles → Dependabot ecosystems
5. Pick audit command for the documented package manager
6. Update docs/08_environments.md § CI/CD:
   - job name, trigger, scope, status (required | optional | not configured)
7. Update docs/02_security.md § Dependencies if supply-chain policy changes
8. New workflow files or devDeps → separate US; manager confirms before merge
9. Note CI time and package cost when recommending CodeQL, Stryker, or E2E
```

## Output template (`08` § CI/CD)

```md
### CI/CD

| Job | Trigger | Scope | Status |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ------ |

```
